## **July 2020**

* Our paper *Dalarna: A Simplistic Capability-Based Dynamic Language Design For
  Data Race Freedom* has been accepted at [22st Workshop on Formal Techniques for
  Java-like Programs (FTfJP)](https://2020.ecoop.org/details/FTfJP-2020-papers/2/Dalarna-A-Simplistic-Capability-Based-Dynamic-Language-Design-For-Data-Race-Freedom). In
  this paper, we investigate the addition of gradual capabilities to a dynamic
  language (e.g., JavaScript- or Python-like) and show how to maintain data-race freedom.
  The paper also shows how programs that may contain data-races may interact with
  data-race free programs, while maintaining data-race freedom.

* Our paper *Gradual Capabilities for Data Race Freedom* (based on
  *[Dalarna: A Simplistic Capability-Based Dynamic Language Design For
  Data Race Freedom](https://2020.ecoop.org/details/FTfJP-2020-papers/2/Dalarna-A-Simplistic-Capability-Based-Dynamic-Language-Design-For-Data-Race-Freedom)*) has been rejected from OOPSLA 2020 (but we got really good feedback
  to continue improving our work).

## **June 2020**

* I am honored to be a program commitee member of the
  [International Conference on Code Quality (ICCQ)](https://www.iccq.ru/).

## **April 2020**

* I presented the paper [Developing a Monadic Type Checker for an Object-Oriented
  Language](https://doi.org/10.1145/3357766.3359545) for which I am a co-author
  at the [Func Prog Sweden
  MeetUp](https://www.meetup.com/Func-Prog-Sweden/events/269811606/), which was
  also the first time that I presented in an online event.

## **January 2020**

* I am honored to be part of the [ECOOP'20 Artifact Evaluation
  Committee](https://2020.ecoop.org/track/ecoop-2020-artifacts).

* Gave a talk about how to produce research artifacts, covering the motivation,
  and giving examples of my experience so far. I gave this talk to the CsD
  Department in IT in Uppsala University ([slide here](files/HowToCreateGreatArtifact.pdf)).

* Finished a series of articles explaining how to use Pandoc, from producing
  epubs and websites, to writing research papers and software artifacts:

  * [Convert files at the command line with Pandoc](https://opensource.com/article/18/9/intro-pandoc)
  * [Turn your book into a website and an ePub using Pandoc](https://opensource.com/article/18/10/book-to-website-epub-using-pandoc)
  * [How to use Pandoc to produce a research paper](https://opensource.com/article/18/9/pandoc-research-paper)
  * [Automating the creation of research artifacts](https://opensource.com/article/20/1/automating-documentation)

## **October 2019**


* Our paper [Developing a Monadic Type Checker for an Object-Oriented Language:
  An Experience Report](https://doi.org/10.1145/3357766.3359545) received the
  Distinguished Artifact Award at the [ACM SIGPLAN International Conference on
  Software Language Engineering
  (SLE'19)](https://conf.researchr.org/home/sle-2019).  This is a joint effort
  with [Elias Castegren](https://eliasc.github.io/). In a tutorial-like style,
  the paper explains how to design a monadic type checker in Haskell. The
  artifact contains an incremental implementation of the monadic type
  checker. This design is based on the work performed on the [Encore
  compiler](https://github.com/parapluu/encore). We are grateful to [Stephan
  Brandauer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephan-brandauer/), [Tobias
  Wrigstad](http://wrigstad.com/), [Dave
  Clarke](https://www.linkedin.com/in/davegclarke/), and [Albert Mingkun
  Yang](http://albertnetymk.github.io/) who influenced the design of the Encore
  compiler.

* As part of my research visit at Victoria University of New Zealand, we have
started a collaboration with researchers from Victoria University, James Noble
and Isaac O. Gariano.  This collaboration will extend the work from our [VMIL
paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.01465), where we are exploring how to add
gradual reference capabilities to an untyped language.

## **September 2019**

* Our paper "Run, Actor, Run: Towards Cross-Actor Language Benchmarking" has
been accepted at the Workshop on Programming based on Actors, Agents, and
Decentralized Control (AGERE!). In this paper, we investigate runtime
performance of the Savina benchmarks, and investigate how many programs have
similar runtime characteristics, and/or that their runtime behaviour may
drastically change nature (e.g.,go from essentially sequential to parallel) by
tweaking some parameters. This observation lead us to propose a single benchmark
program which we designed so that through tweaking of some knobs (we hope) we
can simulate most of the programs of the Savina suite.

* Our paper ["Towards Gradual Checking of Reference Capabilities"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.01465)
(work-in-progress) has been accepted at the [Virtual Machines and Intermediate
Languages Workshop
(VMIL)](https://2019.splashcon.org/home/vmil-2019#event-overview). In this
paper, we propose to mix the ideas from the reference capability literature with
gradual typing, leading to gradual reference capabilities.

* Our artefact "Developing a Monadic Type Checker for an Object-Oriented
Language" has been accepted at the [International Conference on Software
Language Engineering (SLE)](https://conf.researchr.org/home/sle-2019#About). In
this artefact, you can find the multiple iterations of the monadic type checker
from the paper. All the functions are documented, and the artefact guides the
reader through the code. The type checker can be tested interactively from a
REPL, and we include examples of different programs and how to type check them
using different versions of the type checker, and their expected
result.

* Our paper "Godot: All the Benefits of
  Implicit and Explicit Futures" was accepted at ECOOP'19. The abstract of the paper reads as follows:

  > Godot: All the Benefits of Implicit and Explicit Futures
  >
  > Concurrent programs often make use of future,
  > which are handles to the results of asynchronous operations.
  >  Futures provide an instantly available means to communicate not yet
  >  computed results, and simplify the implementation of operations that
  >  must synchronise on the result of such
  >  asynchronous operations. Futures can be characterised as either
  >    implicit or explicit, depending on the typing discipline used to
  >    type them.
  >
  >  Existing approaches to implementing futures suffer from ``future proliferation'',
  >  either at the type-level or at run-time. The former
  >  manifests itself through the addition of future type wrappers
  > which expose the client to the
  > asynchronous message indirections of an implementation and hinders
  > subtype polymorphism. The latter manifests itself through increased
  > latency, by traversing
  >  nested future structures at run-time.
  >  Many languages suffer both kinds.
  >
  >  Previous work offer partial solutions to these problems of
  >    future proliferation; in this paper we show how these solutions can be
  >    integrated
  >  in an elegant and coherent way which is more expressive than either
  >  system in isolation. We describe our proposal formally, and state
  >  and prove its key properties, in two related calculi, based on the two possible families of future constructs (data-flow futures and control-flow futures). The former relies on static type information to avoid
  >  unwanted future creation and the latter uses an algebraic data type
  >  with dynamic checks. We also discuss how to implement our new system efficiently.

## **March 2019**

* I gave a seminar about the gamification methodology and design used for the
  course Advanced Software Design, at the Physics deparment.

* As vice-secretary of ACM-W UU, after a meeting with the CTO of ID24, ID24
  decided to issue a scholarship for 30_000 SEK, for a female student doing web
  research / programming, to attend to a top-conference.

## **February 2019**

* I have been invited to give a teaching seminar, at the Physics
  department, about the gamification approach that we took for the course
  Advanced Software Design.

* The article that I co-author with Lisa Passing has been accepted into DZone.
  This is not academic article, but it is about getting back control of your
  privacy when sending emails. [Read the article
  here](https://dzone.com/articles/keep-your-privacy-and-start-encrypting-your-emails)

* I applied to the [Ahlberg
  scholarship](http://www.uu.se/en/findscholarships/scholarship/?id=113), to get
  funds to visit Victoria University, Wellington.

## **January 2019**

* We submitted to ECOOP'19. Title and details about the paper are omitted until
  the Author notification (Apr 2, 2019).

## **November 2018**

* I presented "Building a compiler: It is all about monads!" at
  [@PartialConf](http://partialconf.com/lineup#kiko-fernandez), where I explain
  how one can create a typechecker with a clean design using monads and monads
  transformers.

## **October 2018**

* I presented the paper
  "The impact of opt-in gamification on students' grades in a software design course".
  ([link to pre-print](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/328115773_The_impact_of_opt-in_gamification_on_students'_grades_in_a_software_design_course))

  Abstract:

  > An achievement-driven methodology strives to give students more control of their learning with enough flexibility to engage them in deeper learning. We observed in the course Advanced Software Design, which uses the achievement-driven methodology, that students fail to get high grades, which may hamper deeper learning. To motivate students to pursue and get higher grades we added gamification elements to the course. To measure the success of our gamification implementation, students filled out a questionaire rating the enjoyment and motivation produced by the game. We built a statistical regression model where enjoyment and motivation explain 55% of the variation in grades. However, only the relationship between motivation and grade is significant, which implies that notivation drives the overall effect of the model. The results suggest that the more the students were motivated by the game, the higher their grades on the course (and vice versa). This implies that if gamification indeed motivates students, then it makes them go beyond what is expected.

* Meeting with Ludovic Henrio, Einar B. Johnsen, Dave Clarke and Tobias Wrigstad
  to discuss the difference between control-flow futures and data-flow futures,
  which was identified by Ludovic Henrio. At the end of the meeting, we are going
  to join efforts to highlight the difference between these futures and constructs
  to allow these futures to co-exist together. We will possibly produce an implementation
  in the Encore language.

## **September 2018**

* ~~Launched the book ICO for "GRASP principles for the Object-oriented mind"~~

* Talk submitted to PartialConf has been accepted. The abstract is written below:

  > Building a compiler: it is all about monads

  > Writing compilers is a difficult task and consists of
  > semantics-preserving transformations, from one phase
  > of the compiler to the next, until the compiler outputs the target code.
  >
  > Monads can help compiler-writers to create a clean design.
  > For example, the Encore compiler
  > uses a type checking monad, which is made up of the Reader, Error and State monads.
  >
  > This talks shows why monads make your code cleaner and why you would want
  > to use these three basic monads.

#### **July 2018**

* My proposed presentation to LambdaWorld'18 Cadiz was rejected.

* I submitted the gamification approach that we took during the course Advanced Software Desgin
  to [EduSymp'18](http://www.edusymp.org/2018/). It was the first time that I have
  worked with [Janina Hornbach](http://katalog.uu.se/profile/?id=N14-1034),
  it was really fun and I am really happy with the result. Hopefully,
  we will be able to carry on the future work of the paper :)

  The abstract can be found below
  (and the paper will be available once we know if it got accepted):

* I will be the new publicity chair for DisCoTec 2019.

* My proposed presentation to ClojuTRE'18 was rejected. My abstract can be found below:

> **Monoids and Monads: The secret weapon to a parallel abstraction**
>
> Why should you consider monoids when designing a parallel abstraction?
> Why monads play an important role in this setting?
> What are the benefits of using monoids and monads?
>
> In this talk, I will save you from creating a non-composable and non-parallelisable library design. To do this, I will show you why your next parallel abstraction is going to use monoids and monads, drawing examples from the (experimental) library ParT. ParT is a functional parallel abstraction that allows the developer to create and coordinate complex parallel workflows, such as asynchronous pipelines of (possibly speculative) parallel computations.
